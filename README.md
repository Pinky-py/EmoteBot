# EmoteBot
A Discord bot, that abuses emote commands. That's it

I like to think that someone will accidentally find this rep and will think about what an idiot I am

Btw you have to use your own token to use this bot's code in the end of `bot.py` file
Also you can use [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=805705515606474752&permissions=0&scope=bot) to add my bot to your server
